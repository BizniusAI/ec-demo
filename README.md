## Motivation for Developing this Project

I wanted to understand how modern e-commerce websites are developed and managed. Using sanity's sdk as a backend allowed for the development process to be efficient and easy to setup.
Also I wanted understand how to use a more modern React framework like Next.js to create fast reloads without the use of an external package such as React Router. 

## Results

This project was difficult to understand but rewarding to develop because of the new features that I had to implement along the way.
